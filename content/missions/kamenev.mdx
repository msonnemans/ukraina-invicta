The father of these children is in need of surgery on his joints in early August; he is barely able to walk and is therefore bedridden most of the day. Thankfully, his operation will be covered free of charge in Przemy≈õl, but they currently have nowhere to live and are all finding shelter in the Ukrainian House.
