The first family to have been helped is Olesia Chychkevych’s family. Her story is rather positive in comparison to others. She had a supportive network and family in Canada ready to help and we have learned how valuable the support from abroad can be. 

Olesia and her three sons have just arrived in Canada. She escaped to Peremyshl in the first days of the war and found shelter at Halyna’s parents home. The first few weeks were incredibly challenging both mentally and physically; they relocated between accommodations, her youngest son, Danylko, became ill and spent two days in the hospital. Olesia also battled her own sickness. But she persevered. She then became a part of Ukraina Invicta when Halya returned to Canada and took on the responsibilities of helping the countless Ukrainian refugees.
